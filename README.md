# Grafana icon select

## Abstract

Sometimes you want to use icon similar as you set/map colors/names in your plugins. 
Grafana already has [many icons inside](https://github.com/CorpGlory/grafana-icon-select/blob/master/icons-list.ts). Let's use them 

It is proposition "icon-select" feature for Grafana. It supposed to be a new directive or something else.

*It is not possible to install to Grafana directly now.* The repo mostly for developers. 
Before really code anything, [*I want to ask questions to community*](#questions-to-community)


## Questions to community
1. Would you use it and how?
2. How to distribute? 
   * Contibute to the main project?
   * Create "app"? 
   * Remove code duplication with `query_part_editor.ts` (extract typeahead feature?)
3. Help me to write nice Angular directive: Model & etc
4. UI/UX suggestions
