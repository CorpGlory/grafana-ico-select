# Grafana icon select

## Abstract

Sometimes you want to use icon simmilar as you set/map colors/names in your plugins. Grafana already has many icons in the project. Let's use them.

It is proposition "icon-select" feature for Grafana. It supposed to be a new directive or something else.

*It is not possible to install to Grafana directly now.*

The repo mostly for developers.

## Questions to community

1. How to distribute? 
   * Contibute to the main project?

   * Remove code duplication with `query_part_editor.ts` (extract typeahead feature?)
2. Help me to write nice Angular directive: Model & etc
