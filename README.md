# Grafana icon select
A demo of "ico-select" feature for Grafana. It supposed to be a new directive or something else.
*It is not possible to install to Grafa directly now*
Only for demo purposes.

## Questions to community

1. How to distribute? 
   * Contibute to the main project?
   * Create "app"? 
   * Remove code duplication with `query_part_editor.ts` (extract typeahead feature?)
2. Help me to write nice Angular directive: Model & etc
